🎯 Day 19 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

🥇 Olympic Medal Scoring System – 2012 Edition

Today, I analyzed the 2012 Olympic results dataset and built a simple scoring system to rank the top countries based on medals:

🏅 Gold = 3 points
🥈 Silver = 2 points
🥉 Bronze = 1 point

Then I calculated each country's total score, ranked them, and visualized the Top 20 performers using a colorful horizontal bar chart in Python (Matplotlib + Seaborn).

✅ What I learned/did:

  - Cleaned and filtered the full Olympic dataset to just 2012 results

  - Created a scoring system with custom weights

  - Aggregated medal counts into a single, sortable “performance score”

  - Visualized the Top 20 countries (and removed the redundant hue legend 😉)

📊 Notable insights:
Countries like the USA, China, and Russia unsurprisingly dominate the top, but the scoring method shows some interesting shifts depending on medal weighting.

💡 A simple scoring tweak can completely reshape how we view performance — especially in sports!
